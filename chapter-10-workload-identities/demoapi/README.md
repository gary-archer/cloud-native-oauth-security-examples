# Demo API

The API can be called from inside and outside the cluster.\
The API also calls its database in a mutual TLS JDBC connection, using its SPIRE identity.

## Run the API

The API uses the minimal Spark Java stack and is built and run locally with these commands:

```bash
./runlocal.sh
```

From a development computer, call it using this URL, which will fail with a database connection error:

```bash
curl -i -k http://localhost:3000/products
```

## Kubernetes Deployment Settings

The API uses a sidecar managed by Istio, with a SPIRE identity, to require mutual TLS for inbound connections.\
The API also downloads SPIRE certificates from the workload API, and uses it in outbound JDBC connections.

## View API Logs

To troubleshoot behavior in the API, view its logs with these commands:

```bash
DEMOAPI=$(kubectl -n applications get pods --selector='app=demoapi' -o=name)
kubectl -n applications logs -f $DEMOAPI
```

## Call the API

To call the demo API externally, run the following command, which returns a list of products.\
The call from the API to the database uses SPIFFE certificates:

```bash
curl -i -k https://api.democluster.example/products
```

To call the API inside the cluster, get a shell to another pod:

```bash
OAUTHCLIENT=$(kubectl -n applications get pods --selector='app=oauthclient' -o=name)
kubectl -n applications exec -it $OAUTHCLIENT -- bash
```

Then call the API with an internal HTTP URL, which the platform upgrades to mutual TLS:

```bash
curl -i -k http://demoapi-svc:8000/products
```
